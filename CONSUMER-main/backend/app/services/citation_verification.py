"""Deterministic verification that a regulation/rule/clause an agent cites
actually appears in the source text it was given.

Without this, citation correctness is 100% dependent on the primary LLM not
hallucinating a plausible-sounding regulation name, softly re-checked only
by a second LLM call (the Review Agent) reading the same fallible context --
a fabricated citation can sail straight through with no ground-truth check.
This is cheap, has zero extra LLM calls, and closes that gap: every cited
rule is checked against the actual retrieved text before being presented as
grounded.
