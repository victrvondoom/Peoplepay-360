# SYSTEM_USER_PASSWORD: jac-scale's scheduler creates a login-capable
# `__system__` account (default password "system_secret"); a random one per
# boot closes that door (the scheduler itself uses a minted JWT, not the password).
# Port priority: $PORT env var (Render injects 10000) → default 7860
# (Hugging Face Spaces). We patch jac.toml at runtime so jac's internal
# config matches the actual port — avoids a mismatch where the CLI flag
# says one port but jac.toml says another.
# The gateway (cmguard/gateway.py) is the only public listener; jac-scale runs
# on 127.0.0.1 behind it. cmguard/serve.py generates per-boot secrets for login
# tokens, narration/translation tokens and the jac-scale system account when
# they aren't set, and stops the container if jac-scale exits.
