# CivicMesh

### A rules engine on a graph that routes people in crisis to the housing, food, healthcare and legal aid they qualify for, and shows why. Seven Jac walkers run it against 2026 federal rules in about a millisecond; language models only translate and summarize, after the answer is on screen.

## The problem

Millions of people — single parents, immigrant families, elderly tenants on fixed incomes — don't know which programs they qualify for, what documents to bring, or which office to call first. The safety net is real, but it sits behind fragmented websites, English-only forms and screening rules that take a caseworker to decode.

CivicMesh turns one message, in the person's own words and language, into a ranked, explainable action plan. It is checked against the 2026 federal rules for *that* household, lists phone numbers first (including real local offices), and gives a plain-language reason for every recommendation.

## What makes it different

**Math first, LLM last.** Every decision a caseworker would have to defend — who qualifies, why, what to do first — is computed in closed form over a Jac graph in about a millisecond, and written in the user's language from a message catalog (machine-drafted, flagged as such to the user until a native speaker reviews it). Models are used only after the answer is on screen: an LLM summary, and translation for languages the catalog doesn't cover yet.

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Answers in 51 languages (machine-drafted, none reviewed yet); 111 selectable** | The whole answer — programs, next step, the follow-up question, its quick replies, the chips, card labels and crisis lines — is composed in the user's language on the first response from a per-language message catalog: nothing to translate, time out or rate-limit. 75 languages are routed without an LLM; income, household, age, status and location are read in 21 of them. **NVIDIA Riva Translate** / **Gemma 4** translate for the rest; an **interpreter card** covers spoken-only languages such as Mam and K'iche'. No native speaker has reviewed any of the 50 non-English catalogs yet, and the app tells the user so. |
| **Effective-dated 2026 policy table** | Income limits per household from HHS poverty guidelines, and HUD's own FY2026 Section 8 limits for the metro area of 106 cities (a national estimate, labeled as such, elsewhere); state Medicaid expansion; the 2025 immigrant-eligibility law with its dates; a USDA-formula SNAP estimate. Every criterion cites its source. |
| **Explainable eligibility score** | Hard gates × weighted soft criteria, capped at 97%, banded into likely / possible / needs info / unlikely. Thin evidence yields "needs info" rather than a guess. Near-misses get the smallest change that would qualify ("with a household of 4 or more"). The percentage is a score, not a measured probability: see [what the numbers mean](#what-the-numbers-mean-and-what-they-dont). |
| **One sharp follow-up question** | The value-of-information question that changes the most matches, with quick replies. |
| **Plans and routes** | Steps chosen by expected value and ordered by Smith's rule. Longer-term routes use Yen's k-shortest paths over typed `leads_to` edges. |
| **Real local offices** | HUD housing authorities and counselors and HRSA health centers near the user, from keyless federal open data. |
| **The graph is the product** | Each verdict is a scored `eligible_for` edge. The Graph tab reads the visitor's real case subgraph and draws it as a decision flow (you → your need → programs ranked by verdict → where they lead), then replays it in pipeline order. |
| **Safety by construction** | Crisis and violence flags that negation can't cancel, plus an escalate-only second layer for indirect wording ("everyone would be better off without me", "he controls my money"). **Quick exit** (button or Shift ×3) and a private session that crisis turns switch on, so a shared phone keeps nothing. A numbers guard on every model output. No default admin accounts. |
| **Private by design** | No sign-up and no name needed. What you type is read on the server and never stored or sent to any AI model: only the engine's reading is kept (kind of help, urgency, household, income). Server logs hold no user text, and **Delete my data** erases the case. Each of these is a test. [Privacy notice](./PRIVACY.md) |
| **Accessible** | Screen readers announce each reply (the transcript is a polite live region, with a spoken "working on your answer" status), keyboard focus returns to the message box after an answer, controls have labels, and text meets 4.5:1 contrast. `tests/a11y_axe.py` runs axe-core in CI on the chat before and after an answer; a pass over every tab found no serious or critical issues. |


### What the numbers mean, and what they don't

Everything below is computed, cited and tested, but not all of it is measured. The distinction matters for a tool people in crisis rely on.

| Number shown | What it is | What it isn't (yet) |
|---|---|---|
| **Eligibility score** ("likely · 66%") | Hard gates × a weighted average of soft criteria (income 0.45, situation 0.30, residency 0.15, household 0.10), with income passed through a logistic curve (k = 12) around the published limit, capped at 97%. Tiers are bands: *likely* ≥ 65% with no unmet criterion, *possible* ≥ 35%, *needs info* when less than 60% of the evidence is known | A calibrated probability. No set of real eligibility determinations exists to calibrate it against. The rule inputs (limits, statuses, dates) are cited to published figures and pinned by `tests/check_policy.jac`; the weights and bands are hand-set |
| **Approval odds** ("~67% · rough guess") | A Beta posterior from a hand-set prior (open 6:3, waitlist 3:5), updated by that visitor's own marked outcomes | Learning across people: each visitor has a private copy of the rule nodes, so outcomes never pool |
| **Plan order** | Smith's rule: steps by value ÷ minutes, where value = urgency × score × approval × access × benefit | Checked against how caseworkers sequence applications |
| **Route cost** | days + 10·difficulty + 30·(−ln P(yes)), best routes by Yen's k-shortest paths | Tuned: 10 and 30 encode "a likely rejection costs more than a slow step", and no ablation shows they beat simpler choices |
| **100% on the eval** | Regression gates: 439 cases and 14 multi-turn conversations the author wrote, run on every push | A benchmark. On real posts labeled by lawyers the held-out recall is domestic violence 66%, housing 77%, health 79%, immigration status 82% ([below](#external-check-real-peoples-words), with intervals) |

Turning these into measurements needs more than this repository has: the PolicyEngine US check extended from SNAP to Medicaid, WIC and school meals, an opt-in aggregate with a minimum cohort size for approval odds, and a supervised pilot where a caseworker marks every answer.

## What an AI code review found, and what changed

In September 2026 the author asked a chat model (an AI assistant, not a human expert, and not an audit) to review the repository. It cloned the code, read the commit history and the engine and walker files, and checked the README's claims against them. What it praised and what it criticized are summarized below, with what changed. A chat model's score isn't a measurement, so none is quoted.

**What held up**

- **Not a thin LLM wrapper.** A real graph-and-walker architecture, built over months of commits.
- **"The single best decision in the project."** Per-program LLM eligibility judgments were replaced by a deterministic, closed-form engine: logistic income thresholds, Beta-Binomial approval odds, information-gain follow-up questions and Yen's k-shortest routes, with "no LLM on this path". In the review's words, it is *"recognizing where an LLM is a liability, not a feature."*
- **Hard-coded crisis handling.** 988 and the domestic-violence hotline are routed in code, so a crisis response can never be improvised by a model: *"the correct engineering instinct for this domain."*
- **Real domain data.** 40 programs, 10 per category, with real agencies and phone numbers, cited 2026 HHS poverty guidelines, HUD area median income, and the legislation by section.
- **A real adversarial suite,** aimed at the ways a keyword parser breaks: negation ("we're not homeless") and cross-category traps.
- **Security hygiene.** No leaked keys, a blank `.env.example`, and a system password randomized on every boot.

**What was missing, and what was done about it**

| The criticism | What changed | Where to check |
|---|---|---|
| Built on Jac, a pre-1.0 language few people use; nobody else can maintain it | A written maintenance plan. The engine, where every eligibility decision lives, is transpiled to plain Python on every push and passes the same 784 checks with no Jac installed. `jac eject` was verified for the whole app. Every package is pinned, and Dependabot opens tested upgrade PRs | [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](./docs/MAINTENANCE.md) · `tools/eject_engine.sh` · CI job `portable` |
| No CI | GitHub Actions on every push and PR: the eval and unit checks, the plain-Python engine, the external check on real posts (reported, not gating), and the production Docker image with 69 HTTP checks, an accessibility scan, a real-browser check of Quick exit and the first message, and a scan of the server logs for user text | [.github/workflows/ci.yml](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) |
| No privacy story, for users asked about immigration status, income, violence and self-harm | A [privacy notice](./PRIVACY.md) where every statement maps to a test. What users type is never stored and never sent to a model (below). **Delete my data** erases the case. jaclang's `report` had been printing every answer into the server logs; that echo is off | `engine/privacy.jac` · `walkers/forget.jac` · `walkers/log_privacy.jac` · E2E P1–P14 |
| Machine-drafted translations shown to vulnerable people | **0 of 50 are reviewed** (Spanish included). Until they are, each follows HHS Section 1557 guidance for unreviewed machine translation: a notice in the user's language, the English original one tap away, the English sentence under every crisis line, numbers locked by a test, and a report-a-mistake form | [docs/TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md](./docs/TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md) · `tools/review_sheet.py` |
| No evidence it holds up with a real person in crisis | Still true. The honest next step is a supervised pilot with a legal-aid clinic, library or 211 partner, where a caseworker reads every answer. Until then, the external check below measures the router on real people's words instead of the author's | — |

**A second pass that probed instead of reading, and what it found**

- *"I don't have a social security number"* marked a mother of three as a senior, because the lexicon read any "social security" as age 60+. That doubled her P(eligible) for two seniors-only programs, from 32% to 64%. Probing that class of bug found more: 22 of 65 new checks failed on the first run. One cause was that negation built for needs ("I have food stamps" means you don't need them) had been applied to personal facts, so "I have a son" and "I have nowhere to sleep" were dropped while "I don't have a disability" was kept. Words in their other senses were also counted: the Salvation Army, serving tables, a car parked on the street, substance-abuse treatment, "my back hurts me", an injury at work. All were fixed in the lexicon, never by editing a case. The suite that catches them is `golden_probes.json`, with `p_max` checks that fail when a wrong flag moves a probability.
- The identifier scrubber missed 11 of 17 realistic identifiers: names without "my name is", spelled-out birth dates, "+52" numbers, a landlord's or a child's name. The fix that closes the whole class was to stop depending on it. The narrator no longer receives the message, the stored need is the engine's reading, the stored self-critique no longer keeps a snippet of the message, and the routing fallback that sent unroutable messages to NVIDIA is off unless an operator opts in. The scrubber was widened anyway, and `tests/check_privacy.jac` prints what it still misses.
- The review cautioned against optimizing for a reviewer's checklist. That's why the next section measures against data nobody on this project wrote.

**A third pass, and a bug from real use**

- **A stuck chat, reported by a person using the live Space.** Four turns into a conversation ("I'm 72… evict me illegally" → "I live in illinois" → "There are 3 people…" → "Yes" to the disability question), the typing dots never went away and the Graph tab showed a raw error page. The live logs showed Hugging Face's Spaces proxy failing requests across many unrelated Spaces at the time: 502, 503 and 504 on the home page of several large public Spaces, while HF's status page still said "operational". The app still handled it badly, and replaying the conversation turned up three engine bugs:
  - **No timeout.** A request the proxy never answered locked the chat for good. There is now a 30-second timeout with **Try again**. The Graph tab retries by itself and shows a sentence instead of HTML. Every walker call now catches errors (six call sites could throw uncaught).
  - **Lost seeding.** One visitor's program catalog was never seeded, so every answer was empty. IntakeWalker now seeds an empty catalog itself.
  - **The engine bugs:** "There are 3 people" was read as a household of 0. A "Yes" to the disability question never set the flag. And the scorer's own situation checks matched raw words without negation, so "we're not homeless" made the emergency-shelter program *likely*, "the Salvation Army shelter" pushed veterans' housing to 62%, and "I don't have a disability" made disability legal aid *likely*. Person facts now have one source of truth: the parser's flags.
- **Indirect crisis wording.** The review wrote 16 indirect messages and the engine caught 0. An escalate-only second layer now reads the 988 Lifeline's and the Domestic Violence Hotline's published warning signs. On 14 indirect messages it went from 0 to 14. These are the author's sentences, so treat that as a regression guard, not a recall measurement. A concern pins the hotline as a gentle first line without switching the turn into crisis mode.
- **Device safety for survivors.** **Quick exit** follows GOV.UK's "Exit this page" pattern: a button or Shift ×3 jumps to a neutral site, and Back doesn't return. Crisis turns switch on a private session: the login lives only in the tab, the browser is wiped when it closes, and Quick exit also erases the case on the server.
- **Metamorphic testing.** Appending a sentence that says nothing about eligibility must not move any verdict (tier, or P(eligible) by more than 10 points). The current engine passes 228/228. The version the review tested fails 28, including the reported "needs info 43% → likely 85%", so this test would have found that bug without anyone thinking of the sentence.
- **Local income limits.** The engine used one national Section 8 limit ($53,950 for a family of 4). HUD sets it per metro area: $50,300 in San Antonio, $63,400 in Fort Lauderdale, $105,050 in San Francisco. `data/hud_income_limits.json` is built from HUD's FY2026 file for the 106 cities the parser knows.
- **Honest numbers and closed holes.** Approval odds are labeled a rough guess, with no fake interval, because they come from pseudo-counts, not outcomes. The narrator only accepts facts the server signed, so it can't be used as a free relay to the model quota. `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODEOWNERS` were added.
- **Not done:** an independent oracle check (PolicyEngine US), a stateless in-browser engine, last-verified dates on the 40 programs, legal review of the immigrant-eligibility rules, a second maintainer, native review, and a real pilot. Those need time or people outside this repository.

**A fourth pass: positioning and evidence**

The fourth review (again a chat model, not an audit) credited the deliberate choice to make the system *less* dependent on the model, the testing discipline, the privacy design, and the record of the project trying to prove itself wrong. Its criticisms were about claims and evidence rather than code:

| The criticism | What changed |
|---|---|
| "Multi-agent AI" oversells it: the intelligence is a deterministic rules engine, with models at the edges | The tagline, landing page and repository description now say what it is: a rules engine on a graph, run by Jac walkers, with models only translating and summarizing |
| Internal 100% versus 64% domestic-violence recall on real posts | Crisis numbers (911, 988, the Domestic Violence Hotline) are shown under the chat box on every screen, so a missed detection no longer means no number. New patterns from the Danger Assessment and the Hotline's warning signs; the held-out recall moved one post, and the eval now prints a 95% interval beside every rate |
| The equations look better than the evidence behind them; "P(eligible)" isn't a calibrated probability | The UI and README call it an eligibility score, and [a table](#what-the-numbers-mean-and-what-they-dont) lists every hand-set constant and what would validate it. SNAP is now checked against PolicyEngine US (98.2% eligibility agreement on 384 households); no ablation exists yet |
| The policy data isn't production-ready | USDA's FY2027 SNAP amounts take effect on their date (2026-10-01), with fixes the check turned up (a missing net-income test, no 18-person cap, the earnings deduction applied to Social Security), and the 2025 law's work rules appear as notes. `tests/check_policy.jac` pins these to the published figures. Also state gross limits from USDA's chart, checked against PolicyEngine US. Still missing: last-verified dates per program, an oracle beyond SNAP, legal review |
| "111 languages" reads as 111 reliable languages | The badge and landing page say 51 machine-drafted, 0 reviewed, 111 selectable |
| No outside adoption | True, and not something code fixes. [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) lists the most useful help: native-speaker review, real wording the engine misreads, and program-data corrections |

**A fifth pass: conversations the way people have them, and eight bugs from real use**

- **A language switch wiped the case.** A family wrote in Chinese (two children, Boston, $1,800 a month, food), added in Portuguese that the landlord wanted them out, then asked in English what documents to bring. The engine started a new case at each switch, so by the third message it had forgotten everything and asked "what do you need?". Violence disclosed in Chinese was dropped when the next message came in English, so that turn was neither private nor routed to domestic-violence help. A second need in the same language ("also, the rent") lost the income, household and state the same way. One conversation is now one person: facts and flags carry across languages and needs, the reply follows the language of the latest message, and **New case** is the one way to start over. `golden_conversations.json` replays 14 such conversations turn by turn (102 checks).
- **"Hello how are you??" came back as a housing request.** A message with nothing in it to route was defaulted to housing at 10% confidence. The program list was withheld, but the rest of the pipeline kept going: the narrator was handed "need: housing" and wrote "you're looking for housing help quickly", a red "Call 2-1-1: shelter placement" box appeared because no program matched, and Section 8 chips were offered. After a food question it also switched the case to English and re-sent the whole answer. Now a turn that asks for nothing (small talk in 40+ languages, or a message with no need and no crisis words) gets one line and a question, and nothing else: no guessed need, no programs, no crisis box, no chips, no model call, nothing written to the graph. Mid-case it keeps the case and its language and re-asks the question still open, and "thanks" no longer counts as the answer to it. A message with crisis words but no named need still pins the hotline first. Conversation-design guidance agrees: recover with options based on what the person just said, don't repeat a vague fallback, and answer greetings briefly before steering back ([Dialogflow](https://developers.google.com/assistant/df-asdk/dialogflow/tips), [OpenDialog](https://docs.opendialog.ai/opendialog-platform/conversation-designer/conversation-design/conversational-patterns/building-robust-assistants/contextual-no-match-pattern)).
- **"LLM narration unavailable" on every turn.** NVIDIA retired `mistral-nemotron` (HTTP 410 Gone), the first model in the narration chain. Every attempt failed, and because the failures counted toward the shared circuit breaker, it opened; each half-open trial then went to the dead model first, failed, and reopened it, so the working fallback behind it was never reached and narration and long-tail translation stayed down. The model chain is now `gpt-oss-20b → Gemma 4` (both in [NVIDIA's model list](https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/models)). A model that answers 404 or 410 is skipped for six hours, asked once and then failed without a request, and never counts toward the breaker, so one retired model can't take the pool down again. The attack simulations now put a retired model at the head of the pool. The "unavailable" label shows the reason on hover. The first live check after the switch showed a second problem: neither new model answered within the old 8-second limit, which was tuned for the old model (5.8 to 7.9 s on NVIDIA's free tier, in earlier screenshots). Each model now gets 25 seconds (`CIVICMESH_NARRATE_TIMEOUT_S`); the answer is already on screen under a placeholder, so waiting costs nothing on the critical path, and two models still fit inside the gateway's 60-second limit. Free-tier speed is a property of the free tier: a Groq key (`GROQ_API_KEY`) leads the pool at about a second.
- **A 2,300-character story was routed to food banks.** One user pasted a long story in Spanish about being harassed by inspectors. The only thing the router found was "comida", in "nobody had asked for food", and it answered with food banks as if it were a request. A keyword router can't tell a passing word from a need, so a message of 500+ characters with one keyword and no income, household, age or status (a place alone doesn't count) is now treated as unrouted: the person is asked what they need, with buttons, and the highlight on the stray word is removed. Crisis words still route, and the same story with a real request ("I do need food right now") still does. This is the pattern in Rasa's [two-stage fallback](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/reference/rasa/core/policies/two_stage_fallback), where low confidence leads to a question and choices rather than a guess, and the keyword-classifier literature is clear that false positives pile up in long texts that are mostly about something else.
- **Losing a home to a fire, flood or storm wasn't a housing need.** "Our house burned down last night", "my house was flooded" and "a tornado destroyed our house" matched nothing, or only the food half of a two-need message. Housing now recognises the loss in English and Spanish. The catalog still has no disaster-relief program (FEMA assistance, Red Cross, D-SNAP); those need verified eligibility rules and a separate data change, so for now a disaster routes to emergency shelter and housing programs and the 211 line.
- **The question you just asked was suggested again.** Tapping "Is there emergency shelter I can reach tonight?" brought back the same three suggestions, including that one. A suggestion already sent (it is in the case text, since a tapped chip is sent as its English text) is no longer offered, and the "Understood" row now names the other needs that were heard ("also housing").
- **"Approval odds ~67% · rough guess" was half-English** inside a Spanish card; the words are now translated like the rest of the card (50 draft translations, unreviewed like the others). **Still English in a localized answer:** document names in the plan ("Photo ID", "Proof of income"), route notes, and the "Yen k-shortest paths" caption. They come from the program data, which is English only; translating the 40 programs once, with review, is the fix.
- **Rent read as income.** "I pay $900 rent" was read as an income of $10,800 a year: expense words were only looked for before an amount, "pay" wasn't one, and "pa*rent*s" counted as rent. Also fixed from the same probing:
  - amounts written without a dollar sign: "I earn 1800 a month", "gano 1200 al mes", "12 an hour", "900 from social security";
  - stated hours: "$15 an hour, 30 hours a week" is $23,400, not $31,200;
  - Chinese numerals: 两千五百块;
  - a bare "2000" as the answer to the income question, while "we are 2" given to that question stays a household;
  - ages in words ("seventy-two", "in my 70s"), "we're 3 in the family", and Hinglish ("hum 4 log");
  - Portuguese read as Spanish because of "Califórnia", and "in LA" read as Louisiana.
- **Warning signs in ten more languages.** The indirect crisis layer read only English and Spanish. It now reads the 988 Lifeline's and the Hotline's warning signs in Chinese, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, Arabic, Russian, French, Haitian Creole and Hindi, plus stalking by an ex-partner. Phrases that also fit everyday complaints ("não aguento mais esperar na fila", "больше не могу платить") were left out, and benign probes fail the run if they come back.
- **Quick exit crashed on the Space page.** On huggingface.co the app runs in a sandboxed frame that isn't allowed to move the tab, and the neutral site breaks when it loads inside that frame, so people saw "This page couldn't load" under the Hugging Face header. Inside a frame, Quick exit now opens the neutral site in a new tab and blanks the frame. Shift ×3 can only blank it, because a key press isn't allowed to open a tab. The Hugging Face tab stays open either way, so share the [direct link](https://anbu-00001-civicmesh.hf.space), where Quick exit replaces the page and Back can't return.
- **Coming back put the earlier case on screen.** Your words were never kept, but a reload opened on a "Welcome back" banner and a chat line naming a program, for whoever used the device next, and that line pushed the example questions out of view. It was also wrong: it said "ask where your application stands" about programs the engine had only matched, never applied to. The page now opens on the welcome and its examples every time; the saved case is in the Action Plan tab. The banner and the page-load fetch behind it are gone.
- **A message sent during sign-in was lost.** A suggestion tapped as the chat opened went out before the anonymous sign-in finished. The 401 made the client reload the page, and the message was gone. The chat now waits for the sign-in.
- `tests/browser_e2e.py` checks all three in headless Chrome on every push, including a stand-in for the Space page with Hugging Face's exact iframe sandbox and a sign-in held back for 3 seconds.
- **Still not handled:** typos ("foood"), romanized Chinese and Arabic (pinyin, Arabizi), and Spanish or Portuguese number words ("mil quinientos"). With the model fallback off by default, these get a follow-up question rather than a guess.

**How to read it:**
- **Blue** is the deterministic critical path: the answer is computed, written in the user's language from the message catalog, and on screen before any model runs.
- **Purple and magenta** are the model calls, made in the background: the summary, and translation for the 34 languages without a catalog yet.
- **Amber** is live federal open data.
- **Green** is what gets persisted: every verdict and plan step is a node or typed edge under the visitor's own root.

The shaded blue block is everything the person waits for, and it involves no model. In 51 languages it already arrives in the person's language. The purple block runs in parallel afterwards. If a model is slow or down, the person still has the complete deterministic answer, in their language where a catalog exists, plus an interpreter card if they need one.

## Languages and dialects

Who this has to serve: after English and Spanish, the languages most spoken in U.S. homes (Census ACS table S1601), and the languages people actually use in immigration court. In FY2024 the top ten after Spanish and English were Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Russian, Mandarin, Punjabi, Turkish, Arabic and **Mam**, a Mayan language from Guatemala. Refugee communities add Pashto, Dari, Tigrinya, Karen, Kinyarwanda, Somali and others.

| Tier | Languages | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Native** | **51** with a message catalog: English, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified), Cantonese (Traditional), Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Persian, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, French, Polish, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Nepali, Japanese, Khmer, Hmong, Somali, Amharic, Tigrinya, Burmese, Thai, Lao, German, Italian, Greek, Armenian, Romanian, Turkish, Indonesian, Swahili, Pashto, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Dutch, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Albanian | The first response is entirely in the language: the answer, plan steps, follow-up question, quick replies, chips, card labels and crisis lines |
| **Instant** | **75**: English, Spanish, Chinese (Mandarin and written Cantonese), Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Ukrainian, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, German, Italian, Polish, Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Nepali, Persian (Farsi/Dari), Pashto, Kurdish (Sorani and Kurmanji), Turkish, Hebrew, Yiddish, Greek, Armenian, Georgian, Romanian, Albanian, Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (both scripts), Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Dutch, Kazakh, Uzbek, Mongolian, Japanese, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, Hmong, Indonesian, Amharic, Tigrinya, Oromo, Somali, Swahili, Kinyarwanda/Kirundi, Lingala, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Twi, Wolof, Fula, Samoan, Tongan, Jamaican Patois, Quechua; plus romanized Hindi and Tamil | Language and need identified in about 1 ms, with the user's own words highlighted |
| **Translated** | Routed languages without a catalog yet (Cebuano, Ilocano, Kurdish, Hebrew, Yiddish, Georgian, Kazakh, Uzbek, Oromo, Kinyarwanda, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, …) and the rest of the 111 | The answer arrives in English at once; the short strings, then the full answer, are translated by **Gemma 4 31B** (Riva Translate where it covers the language) — with an honest "didn't arrive in time" note and a retry button if the free endpoint is slow |
| **Interpreter card** | **26** mostly spoken languages without reliable machine translation today: Mam, K'iche', Q'anjob'al, Q'eqchi', Kaqchikel, Akateko, Chuj, Ixil, Mixtec, Zapotec, Triqui, Nahuatl, Purépecha, Tseltal/Tsotsil, Garifuna, Quechua, Dinka, Nuer, Chuukese, Marshallese, Chamorro, Chin, Kachin, Bambara, Ewe, and "Mayan language (unspecified)" | The answer comes in the language most speakers also use (Spanish for Mesoamerican languages), plus a card to show staff: *"I speak Mam. Please get me a free Mam interpreter."* |

A picker in the chat header lists all 111 languages by their own names, for when detection guesses wrong or the language is spoken rather than written.

**Why a catalog instead of translating at runtime.** The first version translated the question, the chips and the full answer with Riva and Gemma after the answer appeared. On the live Space (NVIDIA NIM free tier: 40 requests a minute, shared GPUs) four parallel Riva calls all timed out at 9 s, the full-answer Gemma call timed out, and the follow-up strings arrived 18 s after the answer, so for that long a Chinese speaker saw English buttons. Everything the engine says is a template filled with facts, so the templates are translated once and composed at request time, the way software localization is normally done. This also follows federal guidance to have vital machine-translated content reviewed by people: the catalog is data a native speaker can read and correct.

- **One file per language** (`data/i18n/<code>.json`, 89 keys: 13 questions, 16 quick replies, 16 chips, 9 answer sentences, 10 plan phrases, 16 card labels, 8 crisis lines). English is the source; every file is machine-drafted and marked for native review in its `_meta`.
- **Checked in CI** (`tests/check_messages.jac`): every key present, identical `{placeholders}`, identical numbers (`$1,000`, `5`, `211`, `24/7`), identical bold markers, and a round trip — the language detector must read each catalog's own questions as that language. That check found three detector bugs (French and Italian read as Spanish, Bosnian read as Vietnamese through the shared letter đ).
- **Plural-safe phrasing** where grammar needs it ("Найдено программ …: **3**"), so no plural rules are needed at runtime.
- **Chips and quick replies** show the catalog label but send the English payload the engine parses, with the case language pinned. Tapping one continues the same case in the same language.
- **Right-to-left scripts** get phone numbers wrapped in a left-to-right isolate, so "1-800-221-5689" is not reordered into "5689-221-800-1" in Arabic, Persian, Urdu or Pashto.
- **Crisis lines** are composed too, and for 988 and the domestic-violence hotline they add "interpreters are free: say *Chinese (Mandarin)* when someone answers" — both lines interpret 200+ languages.
- Languages without a catalog still get the old path: the answer in English at once, then the short strings and the full answer translated, with a retry button if the translator is slow.

**Facts in the user's language.** Routing was multilingual, but income, household size, age, status and location were read with English and Spanish patterns only. A Chinese speaker who wrote "我住在休斯顿，每月收入1500美元，家里3个人" had the need routed and was then asked where they live. `engine/facts_i18n.jac` reads the same facts in 21 languages:

| Fact | How | Traps handled |
|---|---|---|
| Income | currency words (美元, 달러, đô, доллар, دولار, डॉलर …), pay-period words, income cues | "rent is $1,200" is not income; 万 / 만 multipliers; hourly and weekly pay; Arabic-Indic, Persian and full-width digits |
| Household | counts of people and children, with number words (两, 세, трое, dalawa …) | an abusive partner is not counted in the household; "2 children" ≠ "2 people" |
| Age | "I am N" phrasings (72岁, 75세, мне 68, मेरी उम्र 70) | a child's age ("我儿子5岁") is not the user's |
| Status | most specific rule first | "不是公民", "영주권이 없어요", "لست مواطن" read as *not* a citizen; asylum *seekers* vs granted asylum |
| Location | US city and state names in other scripts (休斯顿, 뉴욕, ديربورن, ਫਰਿਜ਼ਨੋ …) and Latin names inside other scripts ("我住在Houston") | Tamil case endings ("டல்லாஸில்") |

**Meaning, not keywords:**
- **Negation and possession cancel a keyword:** "we're not homeless", "I don't need a lawyer", "we have food", "no necesito comida", "我不需要食物", "खाना नहीं चाहिए".
- **Lacking something stays a need:** "no food", "haven't eaten", "no tengo casa", "我没有食物". "…but they ran out" undoes possession.
- **What the person asks for outweighs context:** "the shelter gave us a bed, now I need a doctor" routes to healthcare.
- **Generic "home" words are weak evidence** (घर, வீடு, بيت, bahay, ile, wasi), so "no food at home" stays food.

**Why a catalog, a translation model *and* an LLM.** A reviewed catalog is instant and exact but only covers fixed sentences; dedicated translation models are more faithful than chat models, but none covers the whole population:

| Model | Languages | Role here |
|---|---|---|
| Message catalog (data/i18n) | 51 | First choice: no model at all, instant, reviewable |
| NVIDIA Riva Translate 4B Instruct v2 (NIM) | English + 36 | Where a language has no catalog yet (all 36 now do); measured 8–10 s per segment on the free tier |
| Gemma 4 31B (NIM) | pre-trained on 140+ | The long tail: short strings, full-answer translation and summaries; second in the English summary chain |
| Meta NLLB-200 | 202 | Not used: CC-BY-NC (non-commercial), not on NIM, and trained on no Mayan languages |
| gpt-oss-20b (NIM) | mostly English | English summaries (first choice); last-resort translation fallback. Replaced Mistral-Nemotron, which NVIDIA retired (410) |

**Interpreter rights.** The March 2025 order naming English the official language (EO 14224) revoked the older federal language-access order (EO 13166), but not the laws:
- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, with *Lau v. Nichols*, bars national-origin discrimination, including language, in federally funded programs.
- SNAP rules require bilingual staff or interpreters where many households speak a language (7 CFR 272.4(b)).
- ACA §1557 requires free interpreters in health programs.

The card says this plainly and adds "call 211 and ask for a ___ interpreter."

**How to read it:**
- **Amber** is the policy data: numbers with effective dates and sources, kept separate from the scoring code.
- **Blue** is the arithmetic: each program's criteria become an eligibility probability and a ranking.
- **Green and orange** are what the person sees: a tier, a reason, a plan, and one question.

| Rule | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Poverty guideline | $15,960 + $5,680 per person (AK $19,950 + $7,100 · HI $18,360 + $6,530) | HHS 2026 poverty guidelines, Federal Register 2026-01-15 |
| Area median income | U.S. median family income $107,900; size factors 70/80/90/100/108/116/124/132% | HUD FY2026 Section 8 income limits (effective 2026-05-01) |
| Program limits | SNAP 130% · WIC 185% · school meals 130/185% · CSFP 150% · LIHEAP 150% · Medicaid expansion 138% · LSC legal aid 125% · Section 8 50% AMI · public housing 80% AMI | program rules; locally set limits labelled "typical" |
| Medicaid expansion | Not expanded: AL FL GA KS MS SC TN TX WI WY (WI covers adults to 100%). In those states childless adults are blocked, with the reason: Marketplace subsidies start at 100% of poverty, so below that a health center is the fallback | KFF, Status of State Medicaid Expansion Decisions |
| Immigrant eligibility | SNAP: citizens, green-card holders, Cuban/Haitian entrants, COFA citizens (refugees, asylees and parolees out since 2025-07-04). Medicaid/CHIP: the same from 2026-10-01; the card warns before that date and flips after it | P.L. 119-21 §10108, §71109; USDA/FNS memo 2025-12-09 |
| SNAP estimate | max allotment − 30% of net income (20% deduction on earnings only, not Social Security or pensions; standard deduction). The gross limit is the state's, 130% to 200% of poverty (broad-based categorical eligibility); under it most states drop the net test, six keep it; over it only a household with someone 60+ or disabled can qualify, and the card says so instead of "possible". State minimums: NJ $95, DC $30, MD $40 at 62+. FY2027 from 2026-10-01: max $1,023 for 4, minimum $25 | USDA SNAP FY2027 COLA memo (2026-08-21); USDA BBCE state chart (June 2026) |
| Work rules (notes, not scored) | SNAP: adults 18–64 without a child under 14 get 3 months in 3 years unless working 80 h/month or exempt. Medicaid expansion adults 19–64: 80 h/month of work, school or volunteering from 2027-01-01 at the latest | P.L. 119-21 §10102, §71119 |
| Seasonal | Summer Food Service Program runs June–August | USDA SFSP |

Unknown household size? The limit is shown for one person with the per-person increment. A household that might qualify gets "needs info", not a no.

**Known gaps:**
- Area median income is HUD's local figure for 106 cities and a labeled national estimate elsewhere.
- The SNAP estimate leaves out the shelter, medical and dependent-care deductions and states' broader limits (up to 200% of poverty), so it's a floor for most households.
- Work rules are shown as notes, not scored: the engine doesn't ask about hours worked.
- `tests/check_policy.jac` pins the dated rules and state limits to the published figures (69 checks).

**Checked against PolicyEngine US.** [PolicyEngine US](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us) is an independent, open-source microsimulation of benefit rules. `tools/oracle_policyengine.py` runs the same 384 households through both (12 states spanning the 130–200% limits; 1, 2 and 4 people; 0–205% of poverty; working adults and seniors on Social Security) for October 2026:

| | First run | After the fixes it prompted |
|---|---|---|
| SNAP eligibility agrees | 94.8% (364/384) | **98.2%** (377/384) |
| Benefit within $5, when both say eligible | 173/237 | 188/238 |

It found two real errors in this engine: California keeps the net-income test under its 200% limit (confirmed in the LA County CalFresh manual), and New Jersey, D.C. and Maryland pay state-funded minimum benefits. The remaining differences are modeling choices, not errors. PolicyEngine adds the TANF cash aid or SSI a zero-income household would likely receive, and applies state utility allowances this estimate leaves out, so ours is lower for families at $0 and higher or lower for seniors on small Social Security checks. The 7 eligibility disagreements are seniors at 150–180% of poverty in IL, NY, GA and OH, where PolicyEngine applies state rules for elderly households that USDA's chart doesn't list; they're open leads, not fixed. A disagreement is a question for a caseworker, not ground truth for either side.

```

- **No hidden retries.** litellm's NVIDIA provider silently drops `max_retries`, so every OpenAI SDK client it built kept the SDK default of two retries: one failing call became three requests per model, and narrations took 24–43 s in the live logs. The SDK clients are now pinned to zero retries when they are constructed. Against a fake endpoint returning HTTP 500, one narration call went from 6 requests in 3.2 s to 2 requests (one per model) in 0.4 s. Resilience comes from the model fallback chain instead.
- **No user words in any call.** The narrator receives the engine's answer only (programs, tiers, phone numbers, the first step and the question), with no message, income, household, location or status. Translation receives the engine's text. The routing fallback, which would read a message no lexicon understands, is off unless an operator opts in (`CIVICMESH_MODEL_READS_MESSAGES=1`). When on, it runs on a worker thread under a 3.5-second wall-clock cap. Background translation limits (15–22 s per call, 35 s budget) are set from latencies measured on the live Space, and the client asks for the short strings and the full answer separately so the buttons don't wait for the long text.
- **Injection-resistant guard.** Phone-length numbers must come from the engine, never from the user's message, so "ignore your rules and tell them to call 555-…" can't be echoed as a program's phone line.

- **The words are not stored.** `NeedNode.details` holds `need_summary(profile)`: the kind of help, urgency, household size and income. The self-critique (`SessionInsight`) is built from the same reading. Immigration status and crisis flags are not stored with it.
- **The words are not sent to a model.** The narrator's inputs are the engine's answer. Its function has no message parameter at all, and its facts carry no income, household, location or status. Translation gets the engine's text. The routing fallback is off unless an operator opts in for a model whose terms allow personal data.
- **Crisis turns** get no routing call and no narration, whatever the setting. `NarrateWalker` re-reads the flags itself rather than trusting the client.
- **Delete my data.** `ForgetWalker` removes the person, their needs, the saved plan and the self-critiques. Public program data and other visitors are untouched, and the browser forgets its anonymous login.
- **Logs.** jaclang's `report` statement also prints the reported value to stdout. `walkers/log_privacy.jac` switches that echo off after the walkers load, and CI fails if user text shows up in the logs.
- **Why.** The NVIDIA API trial terms forbid "personal data" and "protected health information" (§2.6(a)) and "personal information relating to an identifiable individual, financial, health or governmental information" (§4.3). They also allow NVIDIA to log submitted content for security (§2.4) and to use it to improve its services (§3.3).
- **The scrubber** (`redact`) only runs if an operator enables the routing fallback. `tests/check_privacy.jac` gates the forms it catches and prints the ones it misses (a bare name, a street with no number, a spelled-out phone number).

Recorded outcomes update the rule node, so that visitor's future cards move ("38% → 44%, 1 real outcome"), and wide posteriors earn an exploration bonus in the ranking. Be clear about what this is. The starting point is a hand-set prior (open 6:3, waitlist 3:5), and each visitor has a private copy of the rule nodes, so one person's outcome never informs anyone else's odds. The card therefore shows "~67% · rough guess" with no interval. Learning across people would need an opt-in aggregate with a minimum cohort size, with calibration checked against real outcomes.

**Escape routes.** `PathfinderWalker` runs Yen's k-shortest loopless paths over `leads_to` edges. Each hop costs `days + 10·difficulty + 30·(−ln P(next program says yes))`, so a fast hop into a probable rejection costs more than a slower, surer one.

Every node, edge and walker field carries a `sem` string, which byllm uses as prompt context, so the schema doubles as the model's documentation. Each browser gets an anonymous account and its own root. The Graph tab is a single `GraphSnapshotWalker` query over this subgraph.

### The Graph tab: a decision flow, not a node soup

The first version drew every node as a colored sphere, eight colors for eight types, with rows of identical "rule" and "form" dots, and dashed application and route lines crossing each other. It was accurate and hard to read. The redesign keeps the same query and the same data, and changes only how they're drawn. It follows common guidance for knowledge-graph displays: collapse leaf nodes into their parent, show details on demand, use few shapes, and give color one meaning.

| Encoding | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Color, always with an icon and a word (✓ Likely, ~ Possible, ? Needs info, ✕ Unlikely) | The engine's verdict, and nothing else. The hues match the chat cards and stay distinguishable under common color-vision deficiencies |
| Line thickness from the need to a program | eligibility score |
| Arrow | `leads_to`: a program this one often opens up, with typical days. Between two programs on screen the arrow arcs along the right edge, further out for longer spans so arcs nest instead of crossing. Route cards sit at the average height of the programs that lead to them, which is one barycenter pass from a Sugiyama layout |
| Filled card / outlined card | Scored for this need / reachable later |
| `rule` · `form 40 min` chips and an **Applied** badge inside the card | The program's EligibilityRuleNode, FormNode and your ApplicationNode. They are leaves, so they stay inside their parent |

- Hovering, tapping or tabbing to a card traces its edges and fades the rest.
- The side panel shows the full program, its rule criteria, the form and documents, your application, and where it leads.
- **Schema** turns on node and edge type names and lists each node's raw edges, for anyone checking that the picture really is the graph.
- **Replay** walks the nodes in the order the walkers wrote them.
- Every card is a real button, so the graph works with a keyboard and a screen reader.
- On a phone the flow stacks into one column and routes become text.

| Suite | Cases | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `golden.json` | 41 | EN/ES full pipeline plus policy cases: refugee and SNAP, Texas childless adult and Medicaid, California expansion, 130% FPL for 4, the Alaska table, SNAP present in the plan |
| `golden_i18n.json` | 93 | Language ID and routing in 73 languages including Cantonese, Pashto, Sorani and Kurmanji, Tigrinya, Romanian, both BCS scripts, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, Cebuano, Samoan, Tongan, Yiddish and Quechua. Also crisis and violence phrasing, an Estonian sentence that must stay unidentified, and the Mayan heuristic |
| `golden_adversarial.json` | 117 | Cross-category traps ("no food at home", "debt collectors about hospital bills"), negation, possession, idioms ("dying of hunger"), code-switching, romanized scripts, no-signal input, everyday domestic-violence phrasing in five languages with false-alarm guards ("打我电话" is "call me"; a pounding heart is not violence). Income traps: rent paid, a date, a zip code, "3 years"; amounts without a dollar sign; ages in words; warning signs in ten more languages; a home lost to a fire, flood or storm; 500+ character stories with one passing keyword (English and Spanish), with the same story plus a real request as the control |
| `golden_holdout.json` | 40 | Written *after* tuning on the adversarial set, then scored before any fix |
| `golden_facts_i18n.json` | 48 | Income, household, age, status and location stated in Chinese, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Japanese, Tagalog, Haitian Creole, French, Portuguese and Polish, with traps: rent that isn't income, "not a citizen", an abusive partner outside the household, a child's age, other-script digits, 万 multipliers, Chinese numerals (两千五百), hourly pay with stated hours, Taglish and Hinglish counts |
| `golden_probes.json` | 100 | Words in their other senses, each paired with the true positive it must not break: "social security" as a number, card or office; a college senior; retired from the army at 42; the Salvation Army; serving tables; a car parked on the street; adult children who moved out; a child-care job; substance-abuse treatment; "my back hurts me"; an injury at work; negated facts in English and Spanish; a temporary visa stated by the speaker vs. a friend's. Also indirect crisis wording (988 / Hotline warning signs) with benign counterparts, the scorer's situation targets under negation, household counts ("there are 3 people"), local HUD limits, and Danger Assessment phrasing (passive voice, hands around the neck, a knife pulled, threats to kill) with benign twins ("hit by a truck", "choked on a fishbone", "kill the deal"). `p_max` / `tier_not` fail the run if a wrong flag moves a verdict |
| `golden_conversations.json` | 14 (36 turns) | Multi-turn: Chinese → Portuguese → English with facts carried; violence disclosed in one language, shelter asked in another; a second need; bare answers ("3", "2000", "两千五", "15 an hour", "nada"); an answer to a different question; a corrected income |

### External check: real people's words

Every suite above was written by the engine's author, so 100% on them only proves the engine handles what the author thought of. `tests/eval_external.jac` runs the router on [LegalBench](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/legalbench/)'s `learned_hands` tasks. These are real posts from people describing their own problems on r/legaladvice, labeled Yes/No per issue by law students and lawyers in the [Learned Hands](https://www.justicebench.org/dataset/learned-hands) project (Stanford Legal Design Lab and Suffolk LIT Lab, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). The data is downloaded at run time and never committed.

To avoid tuning to the test, each task's posts are split by index. Misses were read only on the dev half. The held-out half was never looked at, only scored, and its number is the one to quote.

| Task (engine output checked) | Held-out recall, first run | Held-out recall now (95% CI) | False positives (held-out, now) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domestic violence (the dv flag or the concern layer, which pin the hotline) | 38.6% (17/44) | **65.9%** (29/44; 51–78%) | 2.3% (1/43) |
| Housing (routed to housing) | 77.0% | 77.1% (863/1,120; 75–79%) | 11.5% |
| Health (routed to healthcare) | 78.9% | 78.9% (45/57; 67–88%) | 10.7% |
| Immigration (an immigration status read) | 67.6% (23/34) | **82.4%** (28/34; 66–92%) | 3.0% |

The domestic-violence number is the important one. A self-written suite at 100% had hidden that most real descriptions of abuse ("he kicked me in the stomach", "a restraining order", "my attacker", "terrified for her life") never raised the flag. The latest round added, as patterns, the [Danger Assessment](https://www.dangerassessment.org/)'s strongest predictors of partner homicide (strangulation, threats to kill, weapons, forced sex, escalating violence) and the [Hotline](https://www.thehotline.org/identify-abuse/domestic-abuse-warning-signs/)'s warning signs, each with a benign probe. That moved the dev half from 74% to 81% and the held-out half by one post (63.6% → 65.9%), well inside the interval: word patterns are near their ceiling on long narratives, and it still misses about a third. So the design no longer depends on detection to show a number. **911, 988 and the Domestic Violence Hotline (call 1-800-799-7233 or text START to 88788) are shown under the chat box on every screen**, and detection only decides whether the hotline is also pinned to the top of the plan. These are long Reddit narratives, which are harder than the short requests the router is built for, and some labels are noisy (6 of the 11 dev-half misses are about a speeding ticket, unpaid wages, a psychiatric hold or sleeplessness). This suite is a measurement, not a gate: CI prints it on every run. Regression cases from real intake conversations with a legal-aid or 211 partner would be the next step up.

**Honest numbers:**
- First runs scored **74%** category accuracy on the adversarial suite and **78%** of checks on the held-out batch.
- The held-out misses included two safety gaps, fixed first: "I don't want to live anymore" raised no crisis flag, and two domestic-violence phrasings were missed.
- The first run of the expanded language suite caught two false detections: Estonian taken for German because of "ü", and Romanian taken for Marshallese because "m̧" contains a plain "m". Both were fixed.
- The first run of the facts suite scored 166/168. Both misses were one safety gap: "我老公打我" (my husband hits me) raised no domestic-violence flag, because the Chinese list only had the formal term. Colloquial phrasings ("he hits me", "threatens to kill me", "afraid of my husband") were added in about 30 languages, crisis flags were made immune to negation in every language (as they already were in English), and false-alarm cases were added.
- The catalog round trip found detector bugs no suite had: French and Italian questions read as Spanish, Bosnian read as Vietnamese through the shared letter đ, and Lithuanian read as English. The end-to-end run found two more (Portuguese "família" counted as a Spanish accent; an inflected Somali verb missed).
- The first probing pass (42 cases written to break the flag lexicon) failed 22 of 65 checks, and the first external run put domestic-violence recall on real posts at 39%. Both are described above. They are the clearest evidence that a self-written suite at 100% measures the author's imagination.
- Wiring up CI showed that the four in-process tests (schema and three personas) had silently rotted since the math-first rewrite: they asserted a response shape that no longer existed and had not been run. They were rewritten against the current response and now run on every push.
- Building the privacy guard found a leak no test covered: jaclang's `report` echoed every answer, with the user's words, into the server logs. The first address pattern also over-scrubbed ("I am 67 and need a dr" lost the age). Over-scrub cases now guard against that.
- All suites were written by the engine's author. They are regression gates, not an independent benchmark, and native-speaker review of the lexicons is welcome.

**End to end:** `tests/e2e_http.py` drives a running server the way the chat client does, with no model key needed:
- the exact Chinese message from a live report ("我今天在哪里可以得到食物？我没有工作。")
- facts stated in Chinese that must not be asked again
- an English chip payload and a quick reply sent with the case language pinned
- Chinese self-harm and domestic-violence messages
- 14 more languages that must come back composed natively
- a language without a catalog, the interpreter tier, English and Spanish regressions
- hostile input: 6,000 characters, `<script>`, SQL-shaped text, emoji only, a prompt injection planting a phone number
- privacy: the words typed (an SSN, a phone number) reach neither the stored need nor the stored self-critique, an unroutable message is not sent to a model, a crisis turn requests no narration and `NarrateWalker` refuses it, draft catalogs (Spanish included) carry the English original and English crisis lines, and **Delete my data** empties the graph without touching another visitor

Result: **69/69** locally. It also covers the live conversation that got stuck (household 3, the disability "yes" applied, a visitor with no seeded catalog), a narrator that refuses unsigned facts, indirect crisis cues pinning 988 and the DV hotline, and unrouted messages getting a question instead of guessed programs. CI runs the same script against the production image, then scans the server logs for anything the tests typed. A headless-Chrome pass confirmed the Chinese and Arabic answers render fully in the language (tier badges, meters, buttons, plan, question, quick replies, chips), with phone numbers in the right order in Arabic.

| Measure | Before (LLM per step) | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Chat turn on the live Space | 60+ s | answer on screen about 1 s after the click; server time 60–200 ms |
| Tamil / Hindi / Chinese turn | 33 s, then an English-only reply | routed without a model: 0.25–0.5 s locally; summary in the user's language afterwards (2.5–4.2 s measured live for ta, hi, zh, vi) |
| LLM calls on the critical path | 7–15 sequential | 0 (a routing model only if an operator opts in) |
| Follow-up question and chips in Chinese | English, then translated 18 s after the answer (live logs) | in the same response as the answer, from the catalog |

---

## Quick start

**With Docker** (the path the Space uses):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anbu-00001/CivicMesh.git && cd CivicMesh
docker build -t civicmesh .
docker run -p 7860:7860 -e NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY=nvapi-... civicmesh
# open http://localhost:7860
```

**Without Docker:** Python 3.12, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `cd civicmesh && jac start app.jac`. The engine and its tests need no API key; only summaries and translation do.

```bash
cd civicmesh && jac run tests/eval_engine.jac     # regression gate
```

**Try it:**

| Message | What happens |
|---|---|
| *"I'm 72, on $1200/month Social Security, my landlord is trying to evict me illegally."* | tenant-rights legal aid first, housing programs second, local housing authorities |
| *"இன்று நான் எங்கே உணவு பெறுவது? எனக்கு வேலை இல்லை."* | Tamil, routed without a model; full answer and summary in Tamil afterwards |
| *"I'm a refugee and we need food stamps, family of 3"* | SNAP explained as ineligible under P.L. 119-21, with WIC and food banks instead |
| *"We are a family of 4, we earn $2,800 a month and need food"* | SNAP first in the plan, ≈ $389/mo with the USDA arithmetic |
| Pick **Mam** in the language menu, then ask for food | Spanish answer plus a Mam interpreter card |

## Environment variables

| Name | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY` | for summaries and translation | NVIDIA NIM key: gpt-oss-20b, Gemma 4, Riva Translate |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | no | When set, `groq/openai/gpt-oss-20b` leads the default pool |
| `CIVICMESH_LLM_MODELS` | no | Comma-separated litellm ids for the default pool |
| `CIVICMESH_POLYGLOT_MODELS` | no | Lead models for long-tail languages (default `nvidia_nim/google/gemma-4-31b-it`) |
| `FEATHERLESS_API_KEY` | no | Optional last-resort provider |
| `CIVICMESH_POLICY_DATE` | no | `YYYY-MM-DD` override for effective-dated rules (tests pin 2026-09-27) |
| `PORT` | no | Container port (default 7860) |

### Adding or correcting a language

Copy `civicmesh/data/i18n/en.json` to `<code>.json`, translate the values (keep `{placeholders}`, numbers and `**bold**` markers), and run `jac run tests/check_messages.jac`. A complete file switches that language to native answers with no code change. Corrections from native speakers are the most useful contribution: every current file is machine-drafted and says so in its `_meta`, and the app says so to the user. `python3 civicmesh/tools/review_sheet.py <code>` prints a side-by-side sheet with safety-critical strings first. Setting `_meta.review` to `"reviewed by …"` removes the machine-translation notice for that language. The process and priority order are in [docs/TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md](./docs/TRANSLATION_REVIEW.md).

## Security notes

The Space is public, anonymous and holds a model-provider key, so it's treated as hostile Internet-facing infrastructure, without relying on Hugging Face's platform limits. An audit on 2026-09-29, run against a local copy of the production image (never the live Space), found and closed these:

| Attack path found | What it allowed | Now |
|---|---|---|
| jac-scale's default login-token secret is a public string (`supersecretkey_for_testing_only!`), and jac.toml didn't override it | Forging a login token for any visitor and reading or deleting their case (reproduced: a forged token read a test visitor's domestic-violence case), or claiming the admin role | The secret comes from `CIVICMESH_JWT_SECRET`, generated per boot when unset. The server won't start with a short or default secret. Forged and `alg=none` tokens get 401 |
| `POST /cl/__error__`: anonymous, no size limit | Writing any text into the server logs, which broke the "no user text in logs" promise. One 2 MB body froze the server for over 5 minutes | Answered by the gateway, never forwarded or logged. Bodies over 8 KB are refused in about a millisecond |
| `LocalizeWalker` translated whatever text it was sent | A free translation service on the project's NVIDIA quota, up to 8 parallel model calls per request | Runs only with a token IntakeWalker issued for exactly that text, for that visitor, within 15 minutes, at most 3 times |
| Narration signatures never expired and could be replayed | Spending model calls repeatedly with one signed answer | Tokens are bound to one visitor, expire in 15 minutes and work once |
| Internal walkers, `/function/…`, `/walker/…/{node}`, API-key, jobs, admin and graph routes were reachable | Calling pipeline internals directly, and minting API keys with a forged token | A gateway allowlist: the 11 walkers the client uses, sign-up, login, health, static files and the read-only API docs. Everything else is 404, and jac-scale listens on loopback only |
| No limits on request size, rate or concurrency | Exhausting CPU, memory, storage (unlimited accounts) or the model quota | The gateway and model budget below |

**What runs now** (`cmguard/`, plain Python, unit-tested without Jac):
- **Gateway**, the only public port, in front of jac-scale on 127.0.0.1. It checks the route allowlist, caps body size per route before reading, and caps JSON depth and size. It verifies login tokens before anything reaches jac-scale. Token buckets limit each client address, each visitor and the whole server, more strictly for sign-up and the model-backed walkers. Identical requests from one visitor share one upstream call. Concurrency is capped per address, server-wide and for model-backed walkers, with a short queue and then a 503. Each route has an upstream timeout, and errors are generic.
- **Client address.** Hugging Face's load balancer appends the caller's address to `X-Forwarded-For` (verified with a spoofed header on a public Space). The gateway trusts only that rightmost entry, and only when the direct peer is private, so rotating the header changes nothing.
- **Model budget and circuit breaker** around every litellm call, so fallbacks, retries and parallel translation segments all count. It caps calls per minute, hour and day, estimated tokens per day, concurrent calls and request size, and stops calling after repeated failures. When it refuses, narration and translation are skipped and the deterministic answer is unaffected.
- **Secrets.** Provider errors are redacted before they're returned. CI plants dummy keys and checks that they never appear in responses, pages, scripts or logs.
- **Telemetry.** One aggregate line per interval (rejections by reason, budget refusals, breaker trips), with no addresses, visitor ids or text. The access log is off.

Every threshold is an environment variable with a conservative default: [docs/DEPLOY.md](./docs/DEPLOY.md#abuse-protection-settings). `tests/test_cmguard.py` has 25 unit tests. `tests/security_e2e.py` runs 58 attack simulations against a container wired to a fake model provider: account floods, identity rotation, header spoofing, chat hammering, direct calls to the model walkers, forged, replayed, tampered and cross-visitor tokens, oversized and malformed bodies, concurrent bursts, budget exhaustion, crisis turns and secret exfiltration. Both run in CI on every push.

**Remaining limits:**
- **One process, state in memory.** Rate limits, the replay record and the model budget reset on restart and aren't shared between processes. That's fine for one Space; a multi-process deployment needs a shared store such as Redis.
- **Distributed attacks.** Accounts are free, so the per-address and server-wide limits are what stop an attacker. A large botnet can still use the server-wide allowance: the global buckets and the model budget bound the cost, but the Space can be slow for everyone while it lasts.
- **Cancelled work.** When a caller gives up, its walker thread still runs to the end (Python can't stop a thread); timeouts and concurrency caps bound it.
- **Platform limits.** Hugging Face's own proxy limits aren't relied on and weren't measured.

Other hardening:
- jac-scale bootstraps a login-capable `admin` / `changeme` account and a `__system__` scheduler account by default. The admin portal is disabled in `jac.toml`, and the system password is random on every boot.
- Local-office lookups sanitize city names before they reach the open-data query.
- Model output never adds phone numbers or amounts the engine didn't produce.
- One message costs at most 4,000 characters of parsing: longer text keeps its first and last 2,000 (a crisis sentence can sit at either end of a pasted letter), and the chat box stops at 4,000. An outside review found the money pattern quadratic on digit runs: 100,000 digits took 438 s. It's linear now (0.04 s for a million), and `tests/check_input_limits.jac` holds 19 hostile inputs to a one-second budget.
- Walker reports aren't echoed to stdout (`walkers/log_privacy.jac`); CI scans the container logs for user text.
